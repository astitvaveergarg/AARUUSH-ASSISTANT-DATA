beginning but at this point it had reached its zenith which 
carried on for the entire event. A mimic crew then took over 
the stage performing an act relating to the daily modern life. 
Though the act was welcome and enjoyed the theme was not 
relatable for the kids, hence the whole act was then explained 
by the acting EMC. Dr. Jesus Raja Kumaran, faculty of 
sports, then addressed the gathering. The speech delivered 
also got a great response from the crowd. This was followed 
by a small Aerobics and warm-up session being led by Dr.

already been made ahead of time and the transition between

team put up with the quick and frequent demands of sixty-
five people successfully. Next all the children were then 
escorted to assigned labs in Tech Park where they were 
educated about the general usage of computers and small 
essential softwares such as calculator, paint and word. This 
part of the event saw a lot of curious and interactive children 
coming forward with the urge to learn more. After a one-and-
a-half-hour session the attendees were escorted back to the 
original venue and had another interactive session gaining 
awareness about the first aid kit and how to use it. After this 
the event followed with a string of co-curricular activities. 
First of all was a motivation animated video. It was followed 
up by a maze(puzzle). The origami arc of the event then 
began which saw the birth of swagger in every young’ on 
with a set of lovely goggles and a hat. Then came the musical 
chair game which entertained all but despite being well 
organised was chaotic just because of the sheer number of 
students. With this all the proceedings for the day came to an 
end and the gathering was then addressed by the care taker of 
the ashram. A photography session then commenced. The 
girls were then escorted out and handed goodie bags. While 
the male students waited they had a gala time dancing. The 
organisers also joined the fray. With the departure of the 
boys, Day-1 of Aaruush successfully ended.

The first edition of the youth parliament was organized by the Envision committee of 
Aaruush on 6th and 7th October 2017. The dress code for the participants was either western 
or Indian formal. The agendas for the youth parliament were ‘Introduction of a UCC’ and 
‘Revision of the NEP’ although only the first agenda was covered up due to the lack of time. 
The speaker for the event was Anirudh Vaidhyaa and the deputy speak was Shobhit Mishra. 
There were around 18 delegates, each representing a member of the parliament, either from 
BJP or from Congress. The event flow was based on the UNA-USA modal and its ROP 
(Rules of Procedure) was followed. 

Day 1 - 
The event started at 12:20 with the discussion of ROP for smooth flow of the event. The 
delegates were then told about the sessions that were going to be held. Each delegate was 
given a placard with their names and designation on it. Session 1 was moderated caucus on the 
UCC. Each delegate was given chance one by one to give short comments on the agenda 
within a time limit. General speaker’s list was implemented for giving turns to the delegates. 
Other delegates were given a chance to raise one question on that by lifting up their placards. 
No cross questions were allowed. The event paused for lunch break at 1:30 pm. Lunch was 
provided by the Organizing committee to the delegates and the speakers. During the lunch 
break, delegates also discussed informally among themselves. The event started again at 2:30 
pm and session 1 continued. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Session 2 was a question session. The delegates were divided into parties, one for and one 
against the implementation of UCC. Each party were given chance to ask questions 
alternatively. The interaction of the delegates was up to the mark. To support any statement, 
the delegates tapped their chairs. Session 2 got over at 3:50 pm followed by a tea break. After 
the tea break, there was an unmoderated caucus session. The delegates formed a working 
paper to list the ideas that came up during the sessions. The delegates were given instructions 
on how to prepare for the next days’ sessions by the speaker. The event got over at 4:50. 

Day 2 – 
The second day of youth parliament started at 10:00 am. Another session of moderated caucus 
was conducted in which delegates presented their opinions with assertions according to the 
working paper formed on the previous day. The session was much more interactive and 
informative than the previous day as the participants were completely prepared. At the end of 
the sessions, a working paper was formed which was approved by the speaker. Finally, a bill 
was passed that approved the implementation of a UCC in the country. The session ended at 
1:00 pm. 
Lunch was then provided to the delegates. After the lunch, few awards were given to the 
worthy participants. The event ended with a vote of thanks by the execution board and a 
group photograph with the organizing committee.
