Event Description   

On the 18th and 19th of September, 2017, the Aaruush team organized a workshop on ethical hacking 
“Hacktrack”. The much-anticipated event was hosted by Mr. Sunny Vaghela, an eminent figure in the 
world of network security and intrusions. The event garnered a lot of interest from the participants and 
this fact shone through as there was quite a crowd for the workshop. 
The first day was an introductory session, meant to ease the participants into the field of hacking while 
the second aimed to foray them into the intricacies of the same. 
The first day started off with a host bringing out the Guest Speaker, after chronicling his life and 
accomplishments. Mr. Vaghela came out to copious applause and wasted no time in delving into the 
content at hand. He shared some amusing anecdotes related to his own professional path and regaled 
the audience with some of his cases. He spoke of the technical aspects of hacking and proceeded to 
debunk the misconceptions attributed to it. While sharing his own professional repertoire, he cast a light 
at the inner workings of the big commercial websites and organizations. He shared some real life 
examples showcasing the rising influence of the internet on our lives and also warned the participants 
of the repercussions that hacking may have.   
Mr. Vaghela talked about the various algorithms and strategies adopted by organizations to safeguard 
themselves. After a short analysis, he taught the target audience some methods to override the 
aforementioned safety tactics. 
The second day of hacktrack was much more technical and inclined towards the more complex facets 
of hacking. The guest speaker did another demonstration, this time overriding an offline software. This 
was followed by an in-depth session on Trojan viruses and how to use them to invade other computer 
systems. He went on, expanding on the global trends in the field of antiviruses. He then extended his 
hacking demonstrations to the Kali Linux platform. Mr. Vaghela then ended his session with a few 
words of encouragement for the participants and passed the torch to Mr. Saksham, who went on to 
speak on the phenomenon of CCTV camera hacking. He followed this up with a hands-on CCTV 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
camera hacking example, inviting a great response. The next session covered OTP hacking, which was 
followed by another demonstration. He briefly explained OTP brute forcing before bringing the 
workshop to an end.

Event Description   

The event took place in UB-711,712 Labs on 18th September 2017. The event was supposed to start at 
9000 hrs but due to some delay it started at 1100 hrs. 
It  was  a  workshop  conducted  by  the  Texas  Instruments  on  their  electrical  design  tool  i.e.  Webench 
.Intially, the trainers helped the participants to register themselves on the Texas instruments website and 
get a verification link on their email to use the tool. It is basically an online tool, which is quite light-
weight and enables electrical experts design a sustainable electrical circuit which has stood pass all the 
tests of environment conditions, and overall stability etc.  
Each participant was given individual attention by the trainers present on the venue and after explaining 
all the hidden powers of Webench participants were provided with PDF files to practice their skills on 
the tool and if they were unable to solve the question the trainers personally approached them and helped 
them out. 
The participants were not that active throughout the event as many  topics were not explained properly 
and as a result they were not able to get a hold to the basics. This was basically because of a series of 
errors committed by the  organizing committee  in fulfilling the  needs of the  event. There  was a lunch 
break at 1 pm after which most of the particpants left. 
After the break the session continued and was concluded at 5pm.

Day 1: 
The event started at around 10-00 hrs. There were registration desks setup for the students to 
register for the particular games. The games were CS-Go FIFA-15, COD 4 and Blur. The 
entry tickets were also being sold at the venue. Th event took place in four labs, one for each 
game. CS Go and COD were played in teams of 5. CS-Go started quite late due to late server 
establishment. The Playtonia team provided the server for CS Go. The event was paused for 
a while due to power cut-off. There were some technical issues which due to which the round 
one of CS Go did not complete on the first day. There was shortage of controllers for FIFA but 
the participants managed it among themselves. Other games went smoothly. The event 
ended at 17-00 hrs. 
Day 2: 
The event was scheduled to start by 09-00hrs but due to day one’s attendance and technical 
issues the event was delayed by half an hour. The flow of students was exceptionally slow 
and irregular in the starting hours. Due to the efficient work plan and documentation all the 
students were called and informed about the round timings. The whole event occupied three 
different labs each laboratory hosted a different game. The games hosted were COD-4, Blur , 
Fifa-15 and CS-GO. The day started late for the event coordinators but in time became a 
hectic schedule to overcome. There were many pro shows for round two and hence the 
documentation was also a bit slow. Even after these major setbacks the event was a major hit 
among the participants. The majority taking part were first years but there was a surprisingly 
large number of second and third year partakers too.  
The event caught pace in the later half and all the teams were accommodated well. All 
proceedings were smooth till the end from there on. In the end there were two major issues 
faced. The students qualified for multiple events had multiple places to be present causing 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
huge gaps and waits for everyone. Technical issues due to the specifications of PCs provided 
caused a major time-lapse. The stated reasons caused the event to run longer and the event 
ended at 1800hrs. All of these issues were handled with ease and constant support of the 
organizer helped the coordinators to perform their best

Event Description   

Session 1: 
On 1st of August, the bluebook domain of Aaruush organizing committee organized the event 
– ‘Appearances Are Deceptive’ which was held at room no. 701 in the Biotech block. The 
preparation of the event was finished by 10:00 AM and the event began well within the 
specified time without any delays. As the name suggests, the event was about optical 
illusions. The volunteers sat in rows with their respective laptops and started interacting with 
the participants who entered the room in groups of 2 or 3. The enthusiasm of the emcees had 
the participants captivated and the participants were fascinated to watch and learn about 
optical illusions. There was a total of 13 volunteers who were allotted a number of slides in a 
power point presentation. Their task was to explain their part about illusions to the participants 
as the event progressed. The volunteers took full initiative that kept the participants 
mesmerized throughout the event. 

Session 2: 
The second event organized by Aaruush was ‘Organodissectum’ which was hosted by Dr. 
Veereshwaran, Deputy Director (A.H) Rtd. The event began well within the specified time and 
commenced at 14:00 hrs. In this event, Sir Veereshwaran explained about the various internal 
organs of a goat in detail and carried out the dissection of these internal organs  . The organs 
included heart, eyes, kidneys and brain. The crowd mostly consisted of B.tech and M.Tech 
students and were amazed by the knowledge that they gained during the event. The crowd 
observed the processes with utmost attention and concentration. Sir even cracked a couple of 
jokes during the lecture to lighten up the mood. Sir involved the participants in the event and 
kept them intrigued with a series of questions. Sir even asked a couple of students to perform 
the dissection with him. The poor lighting conditions and low visibility from the back benches 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
led to the accumulation of students in the front seats which led to chaotic circumstances. Due 
to years of expertise of Dr. Veereshwaran in this field, dissection turned out to be successful 
and the students learned a great deal from him.
