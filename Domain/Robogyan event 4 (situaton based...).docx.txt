NAME OF THE EVENT: <insert name here> (Situation based design and implementation event)






Concept of the Event (Theme and Field of Innovation the Event):
The event will require the participants to build a basic robot prior to the start of the event and modify them based on the problem statements provided in the forthcoming rounds.
	



Round wise description:


ROUND 1:


 In this round the robots will be inspected to ensure that they adhere to the competition guidelines.




	









ROUND 2:




In this round the participants will be provided a task to be completed using their robots. In order to complete this task, modifications will have to be made to the existing robot, 


The robots will be judged based on the practicality of the modifications made and time taken to complete the task provided.


The participants will be given guidelines based on which they will have to make their robots, thus ensuring that even beginners can complete the task.










                                                                                                                                                                                    
	



ROUND 3:




In this round, the participants will be given a problem statement based on which their existing robots will have to be overhauled and modified completely. 


The participants will have to add sensory and actuating parts based on the requirements of the problem statement. 


The judging will be done based on two criteria. Firstly, a brief presentation made by the participants about the modifications made and then idea behind them. Secondly, the time taken by the robot to complete the task provided.
