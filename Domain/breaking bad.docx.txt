EVENT : BREAKING BAD


ROUND 1
FUNK FROM JUNK
The participants would be provided with a puzzle which they need to solve. After completing that they need to make a word out of it from the alphabets provided in the junk within a stipulated amount of time.
ROUND 2 
        As we mentioned in the first round that at last the participants will get an alphabets provided in the junk. With these alphabets participants need to frame their team names. Now the room will be divided into two halves. This is a team event so there will be some similar objects present in the two halves of the room. The participants are mouth will be closed(so that they cant shout). The two team mates need to get the similar objects in some stipulated time.
ROUND 3
BEG BORROW AND STEAL
 Using those objects here the team will be given a list of commodities, basically some unique things like a Red loafers, black hair clip etc with the previous round objects, something which is very common but contestants possibly won't carry with them. Along with the list and within stipulated time, the participants will have to arrange the maximum number of commodities they can. They can either beg, borrow or steal and henceforth they will qualify to next round.
Round 4
In this event, the participants will be locked inside a room. The room will consist of a set of clues which the team has to decipher in order to break out of the room. Simple. It could be related to small events . The only twist is that if you do not break out of the room in the given time limit, you are in for a big trouble.
