AARUUSH ‘20
Robolympix IV
Robolympix have been conducted in the past in Aaruush’08,’09,’15 and they have been pretty successful. Robolympix IV is a newer and more exciting version of the previous Robo Olympics fests that have happened earlier. The fest would stretch over the duration of 3 days and will witness a plethora of events which would represent a few sporting games held in an actual Olympics. The robots will compete in games like weight lifting, ball throwing, racing and many more. The events would comprise of both team events and individual events.
Multiple events will be conducted on a span of 3 days. Theevents will be in such a way such that a single bot with only minor modifications can attend most of the events so that a single team or participant can partake in multiple events with the same bot. All the events will have to be of either 1 round or 2 rounds. Similar to the Olympics, the first and second will get gold, silver. At the end of the fest. The medals will represent their positions for the cash prize. Each medal will have a different cash prize. In this way, a single participant has the chance to win more than one event with the same bot. 
Robolympix IV will attract many robotics enthusiasts from inside and outside our college to participate in the event. This event will provide them with an enormous platform for the portrayal of their talents.
This Three-day robotics fest will help freshers to understand and improve their skill in robotics. 
The events that can be conducted in Robolympix IV are:
* 3Basic RC Events
   * The events are in such a way that one bot without any modifications can participate in all of them.
* 3 Humanoid Events
   * Events, in which humanoid bots, which can replicate human motion, participate.
* 2 Special Events
   * This special event involves an ant-sized robot.
   * This special event involves line follower robots.






The Following are the events, which can be conducted.

Name of the event: Maze Runner
Concept of the Event:
The bot has to solve the maze. This will test the participants understanding in solving mazes based on their knowledge.
Description of event:
ROUND 1:


In this round, the bot has to solve the maze in the least time possible. Time will start the moment the bot enters the maze and will stop only when the bot comes out. Participants with least time shall proceed to the next round.




  



ROUND 2:


In this round, the bots will have to solve a bit more complex maze. When they come out of the maze, they need to sound a buzzer in order to indicate the completion of task. Time will not stop until the buzzer is heard.
                        
  
        






Specifications:

2.        A maximum of 12v battery can be used by the participant.
3.          The motor used by the participant should not have torque more than 200Nm,
* we can find the torque by finding out force as mass*acceleration, 
* where acceleration is velocity/time, 
* Where velocity is distance upon time.
4.        No extra arm or extensions should be present in the bot.
5.        The weight of the bot should not exceed 5kg.

8.          The arena for round one will be 2m*2m.
9.          The arena for round two will be 3m*3m.


Judging criteria:
The participants will be judged based on the time taken by them to complete the maze and the control and stability of their bot.
Winners will be decided on the basis of shortest official time which is calculated as:
 Official Time = Best Run Time + Touch Penalty + Search Penalty 
Search Penalty = 1/30th of the Search Time, in seconds 
Touch Penalty= (N/5)*(Best Run Time) Where N = Number of touches during the run.
 For example, if a bot, after being on the maze for 4 minutes starts a run that takes 20 seconds to reach the destination after being touched twice ; the run will have a Official time of 20 + (2/5)*20+ 1/30th of (4 x 60 seconds) = 36 seconds


Rules and regulations:
1. Once the time starts, it will only stop when the bot solves the maze.
2. Time will continue even during human interference.
3. Participants can interfere only once during each round and every successive interference will result in penalty.
4. Any damage to the arena will lead to the disqualification of the participant.
5. Participants have to submit their machines to organizers at the time of registration. All contesting machines shall be collected before the maze is unveiled.
6. Contestants are allowed to: 
o Replace batteries between runs 
o Adjust sensors (gain, position etc.)
o Make repairs
7. The machine may be checked for its safety before the race and will be discarded if found unsafe for other participants and spectators.
8. Judges decision shall be treated as final and binding on all.
9. Only 1 team member is allowed to be near the game field while starting the bot. 
10. Only one member is allowed to control the bot and the controller should be informed prior to the competition to the organising team.
